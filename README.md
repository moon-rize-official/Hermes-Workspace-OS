# Hermes Workspace OS

> An open-source, self-hostable **AI Workspace Operating System** that unifies project
> management, documentation, repository intelligence, knowledge graphs, research,
> automation, and AI agents into a single, modular platform.

Hermes brings together the best ideas from Notion, GitBook, DeepWiki, Obsidian,
GitHub, Linear, n8n, and LangGraph/OpenHands — but keeps **its own database as the
source of record**. Notion (and other surfaces) are interchangeable *interfaces*, not
the system of record. If any external tool is disconnected, Hermes keeps working.

## Status

🚧 **Pre-implementation.** This repository currently contains the **engineering
foundation**: vision, product requirements, architecture, and a milestone-based
implementation roadmap. Application code is built milestone-by-milestone, with
approval gates between milestones.

## Documentation

**Start here:** [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) → the **[Project Bible](./docs/PROJECT_BIBLE/)**
(the permanent source of truth) → [`docs/PROJECT_MAP.md`](./docs/PROJECT_MAP.md) for fast
orientation.

Repository intelligence & governance:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Project Bible](./docs/PROJECT_BIBLE/README.md) | Structured source of truth (11 sections, 50+ docs) |
| [Audit Report](./docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md) | Full repository audit & findings |
| [Project Map](./docs/PROJECT_MAP.md) | Single-page orientation |
| [Missing Information](./docs/MISSING_INFORMATION.md) | Open decisions, gaps, risks |
| [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) · [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) | Contribution guide · history |

The deep design **specifications** live in [`/docs`](./docs):

## Core Principles

1. **Hermes owns the data.** External tools are replaceable surfaces.
2. **Open-source first.** Integrate mature projects; don't reinvent.
3. **Everything is a plugin.** AI, storage, search, and integrations are swappable.
4. **Modular services.** Each capability is an independently deployable module.
5. **Self-hostable.** Runs entirely on your own infrastructure via Docker Compose.
6. **Type-safe & tested.** Clean architecture, contracts, and tests are non-negotiable.

## Getting Started (planned)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cian-omalley/hermes-workspace-os.git
cd hermes-workspace-os
cp .env.example .env      # configure providers
docker compose up -d      # bring up the full stack
```

> The `docker-compose.yml` and application code arrive in Milestone 1+. See the

## Contributing

Contribution guidelines arrive with Milestone 1. The short version: open an issue to
discuss, work on a branch, keep changes type-safe and tested, and match the
architecture described in `/docs`.
